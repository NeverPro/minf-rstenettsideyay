    <h4>26 dec 2023</h4>
    <p>
        Today is 26/12/2023, and I'm just starting to learn HTML. 
        <br> My goal is to make a clone of Millionaire Tycoon World but on a website!!
        <br> In other words, I am going to make a location based mobile game but on a website.
        <br> I will show you everything I'm doing to make that game.
    <h4>27 dec 2023</h4>
        I'm going to try learning css today.
        <br> Also just sayin', I have no idea how I'm gonna make the actual game.
        <br>But since I want it on a website I just started with learning html.
    <h4>1 jan 2024</h4>
        Happy new year! Time to code a bit more.
        <br> My plan is to make another simpler thing with css first
        <br> Also, my files for this website seemingly disappeared,
        <br> so I had to search my whole computer for it. I found
        <br> it eventually, but it was very annoying as I couldn't work on it for a few days.
    <h4>4 jan 2024</h4>
        I have started to learn CSS with youtube. 
        <br> And now I will work with this in school too.
    <h4>6 jan 2024</h4>
        I have now started using CSS! Now it's no longer a white background with black text.
        <br> Now you can also see my website on the World Wide Web! Hello world!
        <br> Thanks github
